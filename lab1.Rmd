```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#install.packages('rmarkdown')
#install.packages("install.load")
library(rmarkdown)
library(install.load)
install_load("mosaic","ggplot2","devtools","tidyverse")
```

2. Find a data set to store in your project
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("kernlab")
library(kernlab)
data(spam)
```

3.	Create a new R Markdown document with html output 
  + Intermediate: have the document create both html and MS-Word output.
  + Intermediate: would it work to also have the document create a presentation (e.g. beamer) from your Rmd file? Why or why not?  

# Intro
a. Spam is a data set collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs, that classifies 4601 e-mails as spam or non-spam. In addition to this class label there are 57 variables indicating the frequency of certain words and characters in the e-mail.Questions about the data:
* Are there certain words that spam emails are more likely to contain?
* What's the best way to block spam emails without filtering out non-spams?

b. Data spam is loaded.

c. Make a table of the first few rows of the data set.
```{r}
head(spam)
```

d. Include an image.

# Summary of Data
a. three variables: mail, you, will
```{r}
(mail_summary <- tapply(spam$mail, spam$type, summary))
(you_summary <- tapply(spam$you, spam$type, summary))
(will_summary <- tapply(spam$will, spam$type, summary))
```

b. The mean of mail is `r mail_summary$nonspam[4]` for nonspam and `r mail_summary$spam[4]` for spam. The mean of you is `r you_summary$nonspam[4]` for nonspam and `r you_summary$spam[4]` for spam. The mean of will is `r will_summary$nonspam[4]` for nonspam and `r will_summary$spam[4]` for spam.

c. Explore your data with a minimum of 2 graphs.
```{r}
spam2 <- data.frame(spam$mail, spam$you, spam$will, spam$your, spam$type, spam$our)
plot(spam2)

```
